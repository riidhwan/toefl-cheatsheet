## Task 1: Integrated Writing Task

### Time Allocation
* Reading time: 3 minutes
* Listening time: 2 minutes
* Writing time: 20 minutes

### Question Example:
**Reading Passage (Sample):**  
**Topic**: Climate Change and the Melting of Polar Ice Caps

The rapid melting of polar ice caps is a major concern related to climate change. Some scientists argue that this phenomenon is natural, while others claim human activity is the main cause. Human activities, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels, have led to an increase in greenhouse gases, which are believed to be accelerating the process of global warming and melting ice caps.

**Lecture (Sample Audio Text):**  
**Narrator**: Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic of climate change.

**Professor**: While some scientists agree that the Earth's climate has gone through natural cycles in the past, there is overwhelming evidence showing that human activities are contributing significantly to the current rise in global temperatures. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from burning fossil fuels, is responsible for trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. The result is more frequent and severe melting of ice caps and rising sea levels.

### Question Example:
Summarize the points made in the lecture, explaining how they cast doubt on the ideas in the reading passage.

### Answer Template:
1. **Introduction**: The reading passage and the lecture both discuss [topic]. While the reading suggests that [summarize reading’s main argument], the professor argues that [summarize lecture’s opposing argument].
2. **First Point**: First, the reading states that [point from reading], but the professor counters this by saying [point from the lecture].
3. **Second Point**: Additionally, the reading claims that [another point from reading]. However, the lecture refutes this by explaining [point from the lecture].
4. **Conclusion**: In conclusion, the professor casts doubt on the reading by providing evidence that [summary of how the lecture challenges the reading].

### Sample Answer:
The reading passage and the lecture both discuss the melting of polar ice caps due to climate change. While the reading suggests that the melting is a natural process, the professor argues that human activities are accelerating it. First, the reading states that climate cycles have caused natural fluctuations in temperature, but the professor counters this by explaining that the current rise in temperatures is linked to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels. Additionally, the reading claims that the ice caps would melt even without human interference. However, the professor refutes this by stating that human actions are causing more severe and rapid ice melt than ever before. In conclusion, the professor casts doubt on the reading by providing evidence that human activities are the primary drivers of this phenomenon.

## Task 2: Independent Writing Task

### Time Allocation
* Writing time: 30 minutes

### Question Example:
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a large city. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."

### Answer Template:
1. **Introduction**: I agree/disagree with the statement that [restate the question]. In my opinion, [state your position]. I believe this because of two main reasons.
2. **Reason 1**: First, [give your first reason and explain it with an example or details].
3. **Reason 2**: Second, [give your second reason and explain it with an example or details].
4. **Conclusion**: In conclusion, [restate your position] because [summarize your reasons].

### Sample Answer:
I agree with the statement that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a large city. In my opinion, growing up in the countryside offers a healthier and safer environment for children. I believe this because of two main reasons. First, the countryside has cleaner air and more open spaces, which are important for a child’s physical development. For example, children who grow up in rural areas have more opportunities to play outside and engage in outdoor activities, which are good for their health. Second, the countryside is generally safer than large cities. In a small town, children can play freely without the same risks of traffic accidents or urban crime that are more common in cities. In conclusion, I believe the countryside provides a better environment for raising children because it offers more space for physical activities and a safer environment overall.

## General Note-taking Tips:
1. **Be Selective**: Focus on the main ideas and key points. Don't try to write down everything—just the essentials.
2. **Use Abbreviations and Symbols**: Create a shorthand system to save time (e.g., "∆" for change, "→" for leads to, "+" for adds, "−" for negates).
3. **Organize by Sections**: Split your notes into categories such as *main idea*, *supporting details*, and *examples*.
4. **Practice**: Regularly practice note-taking during TOEFL practice tests to improve your speed and clarity.
