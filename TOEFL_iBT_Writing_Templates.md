### Question Example:
**Reading Passage (Sample):**  
**Topic**: Climate Change and the Melting of Polar Ice Caps

The rapid melting of polar ice caps is a major concern related to climate change. Some scientists argue that this phenomenon is natural, while others claim human activity is the main cause. Human activities, such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels, have led to an increase in greenhouse gases, which are believed to be accelerating the process of global warming and melting ice caps.

**Lecture (Sample Audio Text):**  
**Narrator**: Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic of climate change.

**Professor**: While some scientists agree that the Earth's climate has gone through natural cycles in the past, there is overwhelming evidence showing that human activities are contributing significantly to the current rise in global temperatures. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from burning fossil fuels, is responsible for trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. The result is more frequent and severe melting of ice caps and rising sea levels.

### Question Example:
Summarize the points made in the lecture, explaining how they cast doubt on the ideas in the reading passage.

### Answer Template:
1. **Introduction**: The reading passage and the lecture both discuss [topic]. While the reading suggests that [summarize reading’s main argument], the professor argues that [summarize lecture’s opposing argument].
2. **First Point**: First, the reading states that [point from reading], but the professor counters this by saying [point from the lecture].
3. **Second Point**: Additionally, the reading claims that [another point from reading]. However, the lecture refutes this by explaining [point from the lecture].
4. **Conclusion**: In conclusion, the professor casts doubt on the reading by providing evidence that [summary of how the lecture challenges the reading].

### Sample Answer:
The reading passage and the lecture both discuss the melting of polar ice caps as a result of climate change. The reading suggests that this phenomenon is part of a natural cycle, while the lecture argues that human activities are responsible for accelerating the process. The professor provides evidence that directly contradicts the reading's arguments, making it clear that human-induced factors, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, play a major role in the melting of the ice caps.

First, the reading asserts that the Earth has experienced periods of warming and cooling in the past, implying that the current ice melt is part of a natural climate cycle. According to the reading, the planet’s temperature fluctuates over long periods, leading to ice formation and melting as part of these regular patterns. However, the professor disputes this by explaining that the current rate of temperature increase is much faster than any natural cycles observed in the past. The rapid rise in greenhouse gases from human activities, such as industrial emissions and deforestation, is contributing to an accelerated warming effect, which is causing ice caps to melt at an unprecedented rate.

Second, the reading claims that the ice caps would continue to melt even if human activities were reduced, citing natural processes as the primary cause. It suggests that these natural processes, such as changes in solar radiation or volcanic activity, are driving the current changes in temperature. However, the professor refutes this idea, stating that scientific evidence shows that the increase in carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from human sources is the key factor. She emphasizes that since the Industrial Revolution, human activity has dramatically increased CO₂ levels in the atmosphere, which has led to the trapping of heat and the accelerated melting of polar ice caps. This human-induced warming is far beyond the influence of natural processes.

In conclusion, the professor casts serious doubt on the reading passage by presenting evidence that the melting of polar ice caps is not just a natural phenomenon but is being significantly influenced by human actions. The rapid rise in greenhouse gas emissions and the subsequent warming of the Earth's atmosphere are directly contributing to the faster rate of ice melt, which challenges the idea that this process is solely a natural cycle.

## Task 2: Independent Writing Task

### Time Allocation
* Writing time: 30 minutes

### Recommended Word Counts
~300-400 words

### Question Example:
"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a large city. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer."

### Answer Template:
1. **Introduction**: I agree/disagree with the statement that [restate the question]. In my opinion, [state your position]. I believe this because of two main reasons.
2. **Reason 1**: First, [give your first reason and explain it with an example or details].
3. **Reason 2**: Second, [give your second reason and explain it with an example or details].
4. **Conclusion**: In conclusion, [restate your position] because [summarize your reasons].

### Sample Answer:
I strongly agree with the statement that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a large city. In my opinion, growing up in the countryside offers numerous benefits for children's physical, emotional, and social development. I believe this for two primary reasons: the healthier environment and the safer surroundings that rural areas provide.

First, the countryside provides a healthier environment, which contributes significantly to a child's physical and emotional well-being. Rural areas typically have less pollution, more green spaces, and ample opportunities for outdoor activities. For instance, children growing up in the countryside can play in natural settings like fields, forests, or by rivers, which promotes physical health and an active lifestyle. Studies have shown that children who spend more time outdoors tend to be healthier and less prone to conditions like obesity. In contrast, children in cities often lack access to open spaces and are exposed to higher levels of air pollution, which can lead to respiratory issues. Furthermore, the peace and quiet of the countryside can contribute to a less stressful and more relaxed lifestyle for children, as opposed to the hustle and bustle of urban life.

Second, the countryside is generally much safer for children compared to large cities. In rural areas, there is less traffic, lower crime rates, and a greater sense of community. This allows children to explore their surroundings with more freedom and independence. For example, parents in the countryside are often more comfortable allowing their children to walk or bike to school or to play outside unsupervised, because there are fewer dangers such as busy roads or stranger-related crime. Additionally, rural communities tend to be more tight-knit, with neighbors looking out for each other, which provides an extra layer of security for children. In contrast, parents in large cities may be more concerned about safety and feel the need to supervise their children closely at all times due to the presence of more traffic, higher crime rates, and the anonymity that often comes with city living.

In conclusion, I believe that growing up in the countryside offers a superior environment for children. The combination of a healthier, more natural setting and a safer, more secure environment contributes significantly to a child's overall well-being and development. While cities may offer certain advantages like better access to education and cultural activities, the benefits of living in the countryside far outweigh these for children, especially during their formative years.

## General Note-taking Tips:
1. **Be Selective**: Focus on the main ideas and key points. Don't try to write down everything—just the essentials.
2. **Use Abbreviations and Symbols**: Create a shorthand system to save time (e.g., "∆" for change, "→" for leads to, "+" for adds, "−" for negates).
3. **Organize by Sections**: Split your notes into categories such as *main idea*, *supporting details*, and *examples*.
4. **Practice**: Regularly practice note-taking during TOEFL practice tests to improve your speed and clarity.
