For example, cities usually have a wider range of jobs and career advancement possibilities, which is especially important for young professionals. I personally found a higher-paying job when I moved to a city, something I couldn't have done in my small hometown. Second, cities provide better access to entertainment and services, such as public transportation, museums, and theaters. These amenities make life more enjoyable and convenient. Finally, cities are more diverse, allowing me to meet people from different backgrounds and cultures, which has broadened my perspective. Therefore, I believe living in a big city is far better for both career development and personal growth.”

## Task 2: Integrated Speaking (Campus-related)

### Time Allocation
* Reading time: 45 seconds
* Listening time: 60-90 seconds
* Preparation time: 30 seconds
* Speaking time: 60 seconds

### Reading Passage Example:
The university has announced a new policy that prohibits students from parking their cars in the main campus lot during weekdays. The university claims this is necessary to reduce traffic congestion and improve safety for pedestrians.

### Conversation Example (Audio Text):
**Narrator**: Now listen to a conversation between two students discussing the new policy.

**Student 1**: I heard about the new parking policy. What do you think?  
**Student 2**: I really don’t like it. I understand they want to reduce congestion, but now I have to park so far away and take the shuttle. It’s going to take me forever to get to class.  
**Student 1**: Yeah, I see your point. But isn’t the shuttle supposed to make it easier?  
**Student 2**: Not really. The shuttle is crowded, and the schedule doesn’t always match with my classes. Plus, when it’s raining, it’s going to be a mess walking from the shuttle stop to the campus.

### Question Example:
"Summarize the man's opinion on the new parking policy and explain the reasons he gives for his opinion."

### Answer Template:
1. **Introduction**: The reading passage discusses [summarize the situation from the reading].
2. **Response**: In the conversation, the man/woman [explain the opinion of the speaker].
3. **Support**: He/she supports this by saying [give two examples or details from the conversation that support the speaker’s opinion].
4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the speaker agrees/disagrees with [restate the speaker’s position].

### Sample Answer:
“The reading passage describes a new parking policy that prohibits students from parking on campus during weekdays to reduce congestion and improve pedestrian safety. In the conversation, the man disagrees with the policy. He argues that it will make his commute much more difficult because he now has to park far from campus and take a crowded shuttle, which does not align with his class schedule. He also mentions that when it rains, the long walk from the shuttle stop to the campus will be very inconvenient. Additionally, he feels that the shuttle system itself is not efficient because it gets crowded, making the commute uncomfortable. In conclusion, the man believes the new parking policy is ineffective and causes more inconvenience for students than it solves.”

## Task 3: Integrated Speaking (Academic-related)

### Time Allocation
* Listening time: 60-90 seconds
* Preparation time: 30 seconds
* Speaking time: 60 seconds

### Lecture Example (Audio Text):
**Narrator**: Now listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.

**Professor**: Today, we’re going to talk about mimicry in the animal kingdom. Mimicry is when one species evolves to resemble another species. One famous example is the Viceroy butterfly. It looks almost exactly like the Monarch butterfly, which is toxic to predators. Because the Viceroy butterfly looks like the Monarch, predators avoid it, even though the Viceroy isn’t toxic. This gives the Viceroy a better chance of survival.

### Question Example:
"Using points and examples from the lecture, explain how mimicry helps animals survive."

### Answer Template:
1. **Introduction**: The professor talks about [summarize the main topic].
2. **Detail 1**: First, the professor explains [first key point or detail].
3. **Detail 2**: Next, he/she mentions [second key point or detail].
4. **Conclusion**: In conclusion, [summarize the overall idea].

### Sample Answer:
“The professor explains the concept of mimicry in animals, where one species evolves to look like another species to protect itself. She gives the example of the Viceroy butterfly, which closely resembles the Monarch butterfly. The Monarch butterfly is toxic to predators, so predators tend to avoid eating it. Since the Viceroy looks almost identical to the Monarch, predators avoid the Viceroy as well, even though it is not toxic. This similarity in appearance helps the Viceroy survive by preventing it from being eaten by predators. The professor highlights how this type of mimicry serves as a useful survival strategy for many species that resemble more dangerous or unappealing species to potential predators.”

## Task 4: Integrated Speaking (Academic content)

### Time Allocation
* Reading time: 45 seconds
* Listening time: 60-90 seconds
* Preparation time: 30 seconds
* Speaking time: 60 seconds

### Reading Passage Example:
The term "classical conditioning" refers to a type of learning where an organism comes to associate two stimuli. It was first discovered by the Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov, who famously demonstrated it in dogs. He found that dogs could be trained to salivate when they heard a bell, after repeatedly associating the sound with the sight of food.

### Lecture Example (Audio Text):
**Narrator**: Now listen to part of a psychology lecture about classical conditioning.

**Professor**: Pavlov’s experiment showed how a previously neutral stimulus, like the sound of a bell, could trigger a response, like salivation, when paired with food. This process works through repeated associations. Over time, the dogs began to associate the bell with food, so even when the food wasn’t present, the sound alone caused the dogs to salivate. This experiment became one of the foundational studies in the field of behaviorism, which emphasizes the role of learned behaviors over instincts.

### Question Example:
"Summarize the concept of classical conditioning as described in the reading, and explain how the professor's example from the lecture illustrates this concept."

### Answer Template:
1. **Introduction**: The reading passage defines [summarize the topic or concept from the reading].
2. **Explanation**: According to the lecture, [summarize the lecture and link it to the reading].
3. **Example 1**: The professor gives an example of [provide the first example].
4. **Example 2**: Additionally, he/she explains [provide the second example].
5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the reading and the lecture show that [conclude by linking the reading and the lecture].

### Sample Answer:
“The reading passage defines classical conditioning as a learning process where an organism associates two stimuli, demonstrated by Pavlov’s famous experiment with dogs. The professor expands on this concept by explaining how Pavlov trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell, which was initially a neutral stimulus. Over time, by repeatedly pairing the bell with food, the dogs began to associate the sound with being fed. Eventually, the dogs would salivate when they heard the bell, even if no food was present. The professor emphasizes that this experiment is a classic example of learned behavior, as the dogs' natural response to food was transferred to the sound of the bell through repeated conditioning.”

## General Note-taking Tips:
1. **Be Selective**: Focus on the main ideas and key points. Don't try to write down everything—just the essentials.
2. **Use Abbreviations and Symbols**: Create a shorthand system to save time (e.g., "∆" for change, "→" for leads to, "+" for adds, "−" for negates).
3. **Organize by Sections**: Split your notes into categories such as *main idea*, *supporting details*, and *examples*.
4. **Practice**: Regularly practice note-taking during TOEFL practice tests to improve your speed and clarity.
